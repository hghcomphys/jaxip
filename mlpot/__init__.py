MLPOT - A machine-learning framework for development of interatomic potential
=============================================================================

MLPOT is a Python package to facilitate development of the emerging machine-learning (ML)
interatomic potentials in computational physics and chemistry. Such potentials are essential
for performing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials at the
atomic scale and with ab initio accuracy.
