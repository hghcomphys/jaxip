# MLAP  - Machine Learning Atomistic Potential Package

<!-- ## What is it? -->
Machine Learning Atomistic Potential (MLAP) is a generic and optimized software framework written in Python/C++ to facilitate the development of emerging machine learning interatomic potentials that are used for performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of complex materials in computational physics and chemistry. 
 
<!--  -->
MLAP is NOT a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package but a toolset to construct the ML-based force fields employed for MD simulations.

<!--  -->
The current focus is on the implementation of high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP) proposed by Behler _et al._ ([2007](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.146401)).
